# Wiren Board - Home Assistant geteway

Gateway to connect [Wiren Board](https://wirenboard.com/) to [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io) 
with [MQTT discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery).

* All devices connected to WirenBoard should be added to HomeAssistant automatically. 
* You don't need to write manually configuration for each sensor/switch/etc...
* You don't need manually configure MQTT bridge. All needed messages between Wiren Board and Home Assistant will be forwarded by the gateway.
* Device availability is also tracked based on [meta/error](https://github.com/wirenboard/homeui/blob/master/conventions.md) properties  


## Installation and configuration

### Requirements

* Linux
* Python >= 3.6

NOTE: **wb-hass-gw**  **CAN'T** be installed directly to Wiren Board, because there is Python 3.5 on it.

### Installing:

```shell script
cd /opt
git clone https://github.com/Hacker-CB/wb-hass-gw
cd wb-hass-gw
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Configuring wb-hass-gw

```yaml
wirenboard:
  broker_host: [YOUR HASS INSTANCE]

homeassistant:
  broker_host: 127.0.0.1
  topic_prefix: my_wirneboard/
  entity_prefix: WB 1
```

### Configuring Home Assistant

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker_host: [YOUR MQTT BROKER]  # Remove if you want to use builtin-in MQTT broker 
  discovery: true
  birth_message:
    topic: 'hass/status'
    payload: 'online'
  will_message:
    topic: 'hass/status'
    payload: 'offline'
```

NOTE: birth_message/will_message are needed to resend all devices after Home Assistant restarts. (like in [zigbe2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/integration/home_assistant.html))

### Run 
```shell script
python wb-hass-gw.py -c /etc/wb-hass-gw.yaml
```


## Full config with default values

  split_devices:

#### Additional types 

Types which are not part of the Wiren Board, but can be added with custom templates for [wb-mqtt-serial](https://github.com/wirenboard/wb-mqtt-serial))

| Wiren Board           |  Home Assistant | Units |
|-----------------------|-----------------|-------|
| current               |  sensor         | A     |

## TODO

* Add support for `range`
* Add support for `rgb`
* Need to delete entities after they will be disappeared in Wiren Board.
* Add device information if available (version, serial)
* Handle wirenboard disconnect

## Known issues

* There is no built-in entity to represent Wiren Board `range` type as editable entity. 
I have tried to use `cover` and `light` for it, but it not looked nice. Suggestions are welcome.
